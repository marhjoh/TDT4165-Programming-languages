# TDT4165 â€” Programming Languages

## Overview
This repository contains the solution to Assignments for the course TDT4165: Programming Languages, focusing on the introduction to Oz programming language. 

## Prerequisites
To run the Oz programs in this repository, you need to have [Mozart2](http://mozart2.org/) installed. You can also access Mozart2 via NTNU's Software Farm. 
Additionally, you can use Emacs or Visual Studio Code with the Oz extension for development, though it will still be executed via the Mozart platform.

## Assignments
### Assignment 1
The assignment comprises several tasks designed to help students become familiar with the Mozart/Oz system. Provided tasks may be located in the [Assignment 1 
folder](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/tree/main/Assignment%201), including the [provided tasks](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%201/Assignment%201%20-%20Tasks.pdf) and [proposed solution](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%201/Assignment%201%20-%20Proposed%20Solution.pdf).

### Assignment 2
The second assignment focuses on more advanced topics like converting postfix notation to an expression tree and processing records. It aims to deepen the understanding of recursive function calls and data structures in Oz. The tasks and solutions are available in the [Assignment 2 folder](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/tree/main/Assignment%202), including the [provided tasks](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%202/Assignment%202%20-%20Tasks.pdf) and the [proposed solution](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%202/Assignment%202%20-%20Proposed%20Solution.pdf).

### Assignment 3
The third assignment explores solving quadratic equations, recursive summing functions, using higher-order functions. It dives deeper into functional programming concepts and tail-call optimization. The tasks and solutions are available in the [Assignment 3 folder](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/tree/main/Assignment%203), including the [provided tasks](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%203/Assignment%203%20-%20Tasks.pdf) and the [proposed solution](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%203/Assignment%203%20-%20Proposed%20Solution.pdf).
