# TDT4165 â€” Programming Languages

## Overview
This repository contains the solution to Assignments for the course TDT4165: Programming Languages, focusing on the introduction to Oz programming language. 

## Prerequisites
- For the Oz assignments (Assignment 1, 2, 3, 5 & 7) you need to have [Mozart2](http://mozart2.org/) installed. You can also access Mozart2 via NTNU's Software Farm. Additionally, you can use Emacs or Visual Studio Code with the Oz extension for development, though it will still be executed via the Mozart platform.

- For the Scala assignments (Assignment 4 & 6), you need [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/) and [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) installed. You can also set up an IDE like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin.


## Assignments
### Assignment 1
The assignment comprises several tasks designed to help students become familiar with the Mozart/Oz system. Provided tasks may be located in the [Assignment 1 
folder](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/tree/main/Assignment%201), including the [provided tasks](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%201/Assignment%201%20-%20Tasks.pdf) and [proposed solution](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%201/Assignment%201%20-%20Proposed%20Solution.pdf).

### Assignment 2
The second assignment focuses on more advanced topics like converting postfix notation to an expression tree and processing records. It aims to deepen the understanding of recursive function calls and data structures in Oz. The tasks and solutions are available in the [Assignment 2 folder](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/tree/main/Assignment%202), including the [provided tasks](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%202/Assignment%202%20-%20Tasks.pdf) and the [proposed solution](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%202/Assignment%202%20-%20Proposed%20Solution.pdf).

### Assignment 3
The third assignment explores solving quadratic equations, recursive summing functions, using higher-order functions. It dives deeper into functional programming concepts and tail-call optimization. The tasks and solutions are available in the [Assignment 3 folder](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/tree/main/Assignment%203), including the [provided tasks](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%203/Assignment%203%20-%20Tasks.pdf) and the [proposed solution](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%203/Assignment%203%20-%20Proposed%20Solution.pdf).

### Assignment 4
The fourth assignment is divided into three main tasks, each designed to introduce you to important aspects of programming in Scala, including functional programming concepts and concurrency. The tasks and solutions are available in the [Assignment 4 & 6 folder](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/tree/main/Assignment%204%20%26%206), including the [provided tasks](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%204%20%26%206/Assignment%204%20%26%206%20-%20Tasks.pdf) and the [proposed solution](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%204%20%26%206/Assignment%204%20-%20Proposed%20Solution.pdf).

### Assignment 5
TBA

### Assignment 6
The sixth assignment involve implementing a concurrent banking system in Scala, handling thread synchronization, and processing transactions. The system handles real-time transactions, including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts. The tasks and solutions are available in the [Assignment 4 & 6 folder](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/tree/main/Assignment%204%20%26%206), including the [provided tasks](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%204%20%26%206/Assignment%204%20%26%206%20-%20Tasks.pdf) and the [proposed solution](https://github.com/marhjoh/TDT4165-Programming-languages/blob/main/Assignment%204%20%26%206/Assignment%206%20-%20Proposed%20Solution.pdf).

### Assignment 7
